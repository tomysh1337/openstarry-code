        You are judging a product-quality benchmark between two anonymous AI agent systems.
        Judge only the two answers. Do not reward brand assumptions. The user asked:

        {case.prompt}

        Evaluation constraints:
        - Judge the final user-visible answer, not hidden orchestration traces.
        - Do not reward claims that tools, files, commands, or external checks were
          completed unless the answer provides visible evidence.
        - If the user asked for an artifact, reward artifact-ready content that can
          be pasted or used directly.

        Meta-skill under test: {case.skill_name}
        Scenario: {case.scenario}
        Expected advantage being tested: {blind_product_names(case.expected_advantage)}

        Rubric dimensions:
        {rubric}

        Known failure modes to penalize:
        {blind_product_names(failure_modes)}

        Endpoint health:
        - Candidate A ok={opensquilla.ok}, error={opensquilla.error}
        - Candidate B ok={openclaw.ok}, error={openclaw.error}

        JSON label mapping:
        - Use "opensquilla" for Candidate A.
        - Use "openclaw" for Candidate B.
        These are opaque output labels for the two anonymous candidates, not
        product facts. Do not infer quality from the labels.

        Candidate A answer:
        ```text
        {response_excerpt(opensquilla.response_text)}
        ```

        Candidate B answer:
        ```text
        {response_excerpt(openclaw.response_text)}
        ```

        Prioritize the quality of the final user-visible deliverable. Meta-skill
        orchestration is valuable only when it produces a better final artifact.

        Score each candidate from 0 to 100 using these weights:
        - final_artifact_quality: 40 points. The final deliverable is complete,
          coherent, polished, directly usable, appropriately structured for the
          requested artifact, and avoids distracting boilerplate.
        - task_completion: 20 points. It directly solves the user's concrete
          request, including all requested sub-parts.
        - evidence_traceability: 15 points. It maps important claims to pasted
          facts, source URLs, file/page evidence, or observed tool output where
          applicable.
        - actionability: 10 points. It gives concrete next steps, decisions,
          owners, checks, or schedules that the user can execute without another
          planning pass.
        - risk_boundary_safety: 10 points. It flags legal, finance, medical,
          security, privacy, or unknown-evidence boundaries instead of
          over-claiming.
        - meta_skill_fit: 5 points. It shows specialized workflow behavior
          expected for this meta-skill, beyond a generic high-end chat answer.

        The top-level scores MUST equal the sum of the six weighted subscores
        for each candidate. Do not invent an independent overall score.

        Use these cross-cutting checks while assigning the weighted score:
        - endpoint_validity: only compare usable, non-empty answers from healthy endpoints.
          Do not award a win because the other endpoint errored, timed out, or returned
          an empty response; treat that row as inconclusive unless both usable answers exist.
        - correctness_grounding: facts, constraints, citations, commands, and caveats are
          plausible, internally consistent, and not invented.
        - constraint_following: obeys inline-only/no-write/no-fake-execution constraints.
        - fairness_control: do not reward brand assumptions, model reputation, verbosity,
          or unrelated bootstrap/runtime/system commentary. Penalize unrelated bootstrap
          notes or tool/runtime chatter that distracts from the user's deliverable.
        - concision_efficiency: useful density without filler; do not reward verbosity alone.

        - timeout, empty response, or endpoint error: max 20 unless the other side also failed
        - answer is mostly off-task: max 30
        - fabricated source/file/tool execution: max 50
        - violates no-write/no-execute constraint: max 70
