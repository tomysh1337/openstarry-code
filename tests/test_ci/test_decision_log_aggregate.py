"""CI guard: the decision-log aggregate library must stay importable.

`observability.decision_log_aggregate` is consumed by two paths that
sit in different parts of the tree:

  1. `skills/bundled/history-explorer/scripts/explore.py` — subprocess
     entrypoint; imports via the `sys.path.insert` bootstrap.
  2. `skills/creator/auto_propose.py` — in-tree library code.

If somebody renames or relocates the module, this test fails loudly
so the duplicated definitions don't drift back into the bundled
script.
