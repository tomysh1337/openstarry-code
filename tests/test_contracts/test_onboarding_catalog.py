"""Wire-contract freeze for the ``onboarding.catalog`` RPC payload.

The catalog is consumed by the Web UI onboarding wizard and by external
control clients, so its key names are a public protocol contract (see
CLAUDE.md: public RPC field names are stable). These tests pin today's
exact key sets:

- Renaming or removing any frozen key is a contract break and must fail here.
- Adding a key is allowed, but for the exact-key-set assertions below it
  requires deliberately updating the frozen set in this file — that friction
  is the point: additions to the wire surface should be a conscious decision.

Everything asserted here is built from pure in-process catalog builders
(``provider_catalog_payload`` / ``router_catalog_payload`` and the
``onboarding.catalog`` handler); no network, credentials, or gateway boot.
