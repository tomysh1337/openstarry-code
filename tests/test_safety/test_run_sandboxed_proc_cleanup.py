"""Regression tests: ``run_sandboxed`` must always reap its child.

The original ``run_sandboxed`` only wrapped ``proc.communicate`` for
``subprocess.TimeoutExpired``. Any other exception (decode error in
``_decode_stream``, pipe ``OSError``, ``KeyboardInterrupt`` after
``Popen``) left a running child with open stdout/stderr pipes — the
process would linger until ``Popen.__del__`` ran, and the OS would
file ``ResourceWarning`` for the unreaped pipes.

The fix wraps the post-``Popen`` block in a ``try/finally`` that
calls ``proc.kill()`` + ``proc.wait()`` on the exception path and
explicitly closes the open pipes on every path.
