"""Cross-session attachment read containment (F-WS-1 / #268).

Materialized attachments live under the shared per-agent workspace at
``.openstarry-code/attachments/<session>/``. Strict-mode reads must allow the
current session's own subdir and shared authored files, but deny a sibling
session's subdir.
