"""Regression test for skill_exec event-loop friendliness.

A skill_exec step that runs a long subprocess must NOT block the
caller's asyncio event loop. The HTTP gateway and the meta orchestrator
share that loop; a synchronous ``subprocess.run`` (the prior
implementation) would freeze ``/healthz`` / ``/control/`` while a wrapped
CLI polled a remote API for minutes.

This test reproduces the scenario with a 2-second sleep subprocess and
verifies a parallel coroutine still gets scheduled (within a 200ms slop)
while the subprocess is running.
