"""The owner-only graceful shutdown endpoint (POST /api/system/shutdown).

This is the cross-platform shutdown path the CLI and desktop use where POSIX
signals can't drain — notably Windows, which has no real SIGTERM. The endpoint
must (1) reject non-owner (non-loopback) callers, (2) report 503 when no run
loop is attached to drive the drain, and (3) invoke the run loop's shutdown
trigger and return 202 for a loopback-proven owner.
