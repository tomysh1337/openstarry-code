"""Writability preflight must probe where ``persist_config`` really writes.

``persist_config`` resolves a symlinked config path and mkstemps in the
parent of the TARGET file. A preflight that probed only the symlink's own
parent passed on a writable link directory even when the directory that
actually receives the temp file is read-only — resurfacing the exact
post-input crash the preflight was added to prevent.
