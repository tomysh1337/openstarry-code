"""The Feishu setup aids must track what the channel actually uses.

The scope manifest is a paste-once console import; a scope the adapter needs
but the manifest lacks means the operator pastes an incomplete list and the
channel 403s later with no obvious cause. Vendor API surfaces (docs/drive/
wiki) are Feishu's own MCP server and CLI with their own authorization flow,
so their scopes must NOT creep back into this channel manifest.
