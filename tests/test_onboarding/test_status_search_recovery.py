"""End-to-end check that the advertised search recovery one-liner is safe.

``onboard status`` and the next-steps guidance advertise
``openstarry-code onboard configure search --search-provider duckduckgo`` as the
headless recovery path. Re-running it on a config that already carries
operator-tuned global search settings must keep those settings (keep-current
semantics for every omitted flag), otherwise the recovery advice itself
resets the operator's configuration.
