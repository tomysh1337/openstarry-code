"""Byte-level MIME sniffing shared by every attachment admission surface.

Lives in ``contracts`` (not the gateway) so policy-only consumers — the
upload route, the CLI, channel adapters — can sniff without importing
gateway internals. Only magic bytes and complete-payload checks are used;
no member of a container is ever decompressed beyond the zip central
directory, so sniffing is not an extraction vector.
