"""Per-provider dialect policy for the OpenAI-compatible backend.

Twenty-plus providers share ``OpenAIProvider``. What tells them apart is not
code but *data*: which token-limit field the upstream accepts, which JSON
Schema keywords it rejects, whether it leaks MiniMax's plain-text tool
protocol, whether its billed cost can be trusted, which models need explicit
thinking toggles. ``OpenAICompatPolicy`` is that data — one frozen record per
``provider_kind``, consumed by the request builder and stream loop instead of
``provider_kind == ...`` branches scattered through them.

The registry attaches a policy to every ``ProviderSpec``; constructing an
``OpenAIProvider`` without one falls back to the kind-keyed default so
direct construction (tests, tooling) behaves identically to the registry
path.
