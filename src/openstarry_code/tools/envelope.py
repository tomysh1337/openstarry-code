"""Tool failure envelope.

Single helper that converts any exception raised by a tool handler into a
stable, user-facing JSON envelope. Keys are fixed and exhaustive:

    {"status": "error",
     "tool": <str>,
     "error_class": <str>,
     "user_message": <str>,
     "retry_allowed": <bool>}

No raw ``repr(exc)`` and no traceback text ever leaks into the envelope —
the ``user_message`` field is sanitised so it is safe to show to an end
user or write to a channel transcript.

Callers expect a ``dict[str, Any]`` with exactly these five keys. Extra
keys are a breaking change; additions go through a new slice.
