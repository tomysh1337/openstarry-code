"""Registration of the ``meta_invoke`` tool.

The tool exists in the registry so it appears in the LLM's tool
catalogue and so policy checks apply via the standard dispatcher
preflight. Its handler body is a routing guard: the actual execution
happens inside ``Agent._run_one_streaming``, which intercepts
``tc.tool_name == 'meta_invoke'`` before the standard ``_execute_tool``
path. If this handler ever fires, something is misconfigured.

Visibility: ``exposed_by_default=False``. ``meta_invoke`` is
conditionally surfaced by ``SkillInjector`` (via
``ToolContext.surfaced_tools``) when at least one ``kind=meta`` skill
is present in ``<available_skills>``. Until Task 4 (SkillInjector)
wires this up, the tool will NOT be visible to the LLM at all — that
is intentional, as exposing the tool with no meta-skills in the
catalogue would invite hallucinated calls.

See ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-meta-invoke-soft-activation-design.md``.
