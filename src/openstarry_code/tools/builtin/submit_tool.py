"""Registration of the ``submit`` tool.

The tool exists in the registry so it appears in the LLM's tool catalogue and
so policy checks apply via the standard dispatcher preflight. Its handler body
is a routing guard: the actual behaviour happens inside
``Agent._run_one_streaming``'s dispatch loop, which intercepts
``tc.tool_name == 'submit'`` before the standard ``_execute_tool`` path and
returns a synthetic review/confirmation result. If this handler ever fires,
something is misconfigured.

Visibility: ``exposed_by_default=False``. ``submit`` is surfaced per-run via
``ToolContext.surfaced_tools`` only when the ``submit_review`` lever is enabled
(see ``engine/runtime.py``); with the lever off the tool is absent from the
catalogue and the interception branch is dead, so behaviour is unchanged.
