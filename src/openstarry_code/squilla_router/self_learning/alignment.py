"""Offline label alignment for the router self-learning loop.

Turns a session's captured runtime signals (the model's raw prediction plus the
heuristic markers — complaint, confidence gate, anti-downgrade) into a corrected
supervised label per turn.

Pure functions over :class:`RouterTrainSample`; no IO, no raw text (alignment
relies only on the captured boolean/class signals), so it is fully unit-testable.
