"""Trigger gating for ``maybe_run_update_router``.

The cron/post-dream hook only provides the *opportunity* to check; this AND-gate
chain decides whether training actually runs. Every gate must pass. Keeping this
a pure function (state + stats + config + now -> decision) makes the policy fully
unit-testable and side-effect free.
