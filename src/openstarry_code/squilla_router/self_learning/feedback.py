"""Explicit user feedback (thumbs up/down) sidecar for the self-learning loop.

Feedback lives in its own append-only JSONL next to (not inside) the captured
samples: a sample row is written once when the turn ends, while a rating can
arrive minutes or days later and be revised (last-write-wins) or revoked
(``neutral``). The offline trainer joins the two streams by ``decision_id``
at dataset-build time (samples carry the same V017 id).

Every row also carries the ``executed_kind`` of the decision it rates
(``single`` | ``ensemble``). The distinction is load-bearing downstream: an
ensemble turn's rating judges the whole candidates-plus-aggregator chain, so
alignment must not convert it into a tier-upgrade label, and the rollback
monitor must not attribute it to the routing classifier.

Same conventions as ``store.py``: pure functions, injectable ``home``, no
raw prompt text, best-effort retention pruning at write time.
