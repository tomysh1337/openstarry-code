"""Active-bundle pointer, atomic promotion, quarantine, and rollback.

The shipped baseline under ``site-packages`` is never mutated. A single pointer
file ``~/.openstarry-code/router/active`` selects which bundle the router loads:

    baseline            -> the packaged/configured base bundle
    learned/<version>   -> a promoted candidate under router/learned/<version>

Promotion and rollback are just atomic rewrites of that one pointer, so a bad
candidate is reverted by pointing back to ``baseline``. A promoted candidate is
additionally pinned to the base bundle it was trained from
(``learned_manifest.json: base_fingerprint``); when a package upgrade replaces
the shipped weights, :func:`verify_active_bundle` detects the mismatch, resets
the pointer, and quarantines the stale candidate instead of serving a hybrid of
new projections and an old head.
