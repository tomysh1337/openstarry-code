"""Squilla Router self-learning loop.

Online side only: capture per-turn routing decisions plus the feature vectors
the model actually computed, so an offline trainer can later realign labels
from negative feedback and incrementally retrain the classifier.

* Raw prompt text is never stored. The training payload is the float16
  ``features_390`` vector the model already produced at inference time.
* All capture is opt-in and best-effort; nothing here may break a turn.
