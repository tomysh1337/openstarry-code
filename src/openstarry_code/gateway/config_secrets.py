"""Single home for config-mutation runtime-secret inheritance (D19).

Every config-mutation surface must treat runtime-secret markers identically:
the RPC ``config.set`` / ``config.patch`` / ``config.apply`` handlers and the
onboarding ``upsert_*`` mutations. This module owns that one implementation so
the rule can never drift between surfaces.

Two concerns live here, both part of the same secret-inheritance contract:

* **Redaction round-trip.** A control surface reads config back with every
  secret masked to the public marker (``"[redacted]"``). When the client
  re-submits that public object, :func:`restore_redacted_values` swaps each
  marker at a secret-named path back to the currently-stored secret value and
  reports the set of paths it restored, so a re-save never wipes a secret the
  client only ever saw redacted.

* **D19 inherit-then-clear-explicit.** :func:`inherit_then_clear_explicit`
  first inherits the currently-stored runtime-secret markers onto the candidate
  config, then clears the marker at every path the mutation set with an
  *explicit* new value. A path whose value was the marker (restored/inherited)
  keeps its marker; an explicit new value replaces the secret and un-marks the
  path so a later persist writes it to disk.

The marker constant here is the write-side twin of ``config._REDACTED`` (the
read-side redaction value); both are the literal ``"[redacted]"``. It is kept
as a local literal so this module has no import-time dependency on
``openstarry_code.gateway.config`` (matching the lazy-import discipline the config
RPC/onboarding surfaces rely on during boot).
