"""Gateway RPC scope policy — single source of truth.

Every release-surface gateway method registered against ``RpcRegistry``
must appear here, either as an explicit entry in ``METHOD_SCOPES`` /
``NODE_ROLE_METHODS`` or be matched by an entry in
``ADMIN_METHOD_PREFIXES``. The registry audits this invariant at boot and
then locks the process-wide method surface, so a missing classification or
late module import fails loudly rather than silently changing request-time
authorization.

Scope implication is namespace-bounded:

* ``operator.admin`` satisfies any ``operator.*`` requirement.
* ``operator.write`` satisfies ``operator.read``.
* No implication crosses the ``operator.*`` boundary into other scope
  namespaces (``node``, future ``system.*``, plugin scopes).

The shape of the table follows the gateway method-scope contract. See
``THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`` for relevant attributions. The Python
implementation is independent.
