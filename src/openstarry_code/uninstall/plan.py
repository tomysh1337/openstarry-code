"""Pure planning: turn an :class:`Inventory` + options into an :class:`UninstallPlan`.

This module performs **no I/O** beyond reading the inventory snapshot it is
handed (which itself globbed/stat'd at discovery time). It decides *what* would
happen — the ordered list of stop/remove/purge actions, what is kept, and what
the user must handle manually — so ``--dry-run`` and ``--json`` render exactly
what execution will do.
