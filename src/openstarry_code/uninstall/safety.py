"""Safety primitives for the uninstaller — path containment and protected-root guards.

Every destructive operation routes through here. The invariants this module
enforces (so the rest of the uninstaller can stay simple):

* **Containment** — a target is only deletable when, after symlink resolution, it
  is at or under a resolved root. :func:`is_within` mirrors the proven idiom in
  ``skills/hub/installer._is_relative_to`` / ``skills/loader``.
* **Protected roots** — the OpenStarry Code "home" is whatever ``OPENSTARRY_CODE_STATE_DIR``
  (or a relocated ``config.state_dir``) points at, with *zero* validation in
  ``paths.py``. A misconfiguration could aim it at ``$HOME``, ``/``, or
  ``~/Documents``. :func:`protected_root_reason` refuses to treat such paths as a
  blanket-deletion root, so a relocation can never escalate ``--purge-all`` into
  wiping unrelated user data.
