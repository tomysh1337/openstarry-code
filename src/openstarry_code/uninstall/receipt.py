"""Install receipt — an optional manifest installers write to aid uninstall.

The receipt records how OpenStarry Code was installed (method, entrypoints, owned
paths) so the uninstaller can act precisely instead of inferring everything at
runtime. It is a *hint*, never sole deletion authority: the uninstaller still
re-verifies containment and protected-root rules before deleting anything a
receipt lists, so a stale or hand-edited receipt cannot widen the blast radius.

Installs that predate receipts (every install in the field today) simply have no
receipt; the uninstaller falls back to runtime inventory ("conservative mode").
