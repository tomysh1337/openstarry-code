"""Runner-authoritative red→green→regression verification.

The agent writes a machine-readable manifest (verification.json) into the
scratch dir declaring its acceptance tests. The runner does NOT trust the
agent's self-report: it independently re-runs each acceptance command at the
task HEAD (green) and, in a throwaway ``git worktree`` at the base commit
with the agent's test files overlaid, at the base (red). This distinguishes
a genuine fix from a no-op, and surfaces the false-negative states the
design review (#6) called out.

    such a command in the base worktree to establish the red state, that
    absolute ``cd`` would teleport execution back into the agent-fixed task
    repo and silently contaminate the check (the test passes against the fix,

    as a loudly-warned last resort (see :func:`_resolve_bash`). Native
