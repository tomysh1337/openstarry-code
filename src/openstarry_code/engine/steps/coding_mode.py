"""Pre-turn step: enforce coding mode when the operator toggle is ON.

Coding mode is an operator toggle, not an intent classifier. While it is ON,
turns with the complete code-task launch surface get a directive that steers
code changes through the code-task plugin (``openstarry-code code-task solve``)
instead of letting the agent clone and hand-edit repositories itself (which
skips the runner-verified red->green proof). Restricted surfaces that cannot
launch code-task receive neither the directive nor the skill. No per-message
detection is performed.

The directive does NOT tell the agent to run a BARE ``opensquilla``: the gateway
shell tools inherit the gateway process PATH, which frequently does NOT contain
the CLI's bin (the gateway is commonly started via an absolute interpreter path
or a packaged desktop binary). A bare command then fails to resolve, and the
agent tends to "self-install" and degrade to hand-editing. So the directive
injects a PATH-independent invocation resolved from the running process (see
``resolve_code_task_command``), and falls back to a fail-loud directive when
code-task cannot be run at all.
