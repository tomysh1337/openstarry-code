"""Pipeline step + stores for trusted meta-skill control launches.

The ``/meta`` command surface does NOT start a meta-skill turn directly.
Instead the ``meta.run`` RPC stamps a *pending launch* into a small
session-keyed, in-process store; the surface then sends a normal turn.
On that next turn the :func:`meta_command_launch` pipeline step pops the
pending launch and writes ``ctx.metadata["meta_launch"] = {"name": ...}``.
The launch turn may also carry an explicit user request using
``/meta <name> -- <request>``; in that case the marker includes ``request``
so the orchestrator receives the request instead of the command wrapper.

The store is intentionally minimal:

* keyed by session id (the pipeline's ``session_key``);
* one-shot — :func:`pending_meta_launch_pop` consumes the entry atomically
  so a launch fires on exactly one turn;
* optionally bound to the durable ``clientRequestId`` shared by ``meta.run``
  and its launch turn. Consumed ids leave a short-lived, bounded tombstone so
  a late duplicate ``meta.run`` cannot recreate a marker after ``chat.send``
  has already been accepted;
* identified markers start with a short staging TTL. Durable chat acceptance
  promotes an exact, valid launch to accepted state before runtime activation;
  accepted markers never time-expire while their turn waits in a queue;
* retained as a compatibility cache; identified production launches are also
  staged in the session database and bound to their accepted ingress turn, so
  this cache may be empty after a gateway restart without losing the intent;
* claimed only by its own launch turn — every surface stamps the launch and
  then sends a turn whose text is the ``/meta <name>`` sentinel, optionally
  followed by ``-- <request>``, so
  :func:`meta_command_launch` consumes the pending entry only when the turn
  message matches that sentinel. A stale stamp (whose launch turn never
  arrived) is never drained by an unrelated normal turn, so it cannot hijack
  the next ordinary message.

The locking pattern mirrors the sticky-cache helpers in
``openstarry_code.engine.steps.meta_resolution`` (``_sticky_get`` /
``_sticky_put`` / ``_sticky_drop``).

Failed-step replay uses a separate nonce-keyed store and an exact, token-free
``/meta-replay <nonce>`` sentinel.  The replay capability token is consumed by
the gateway RPC *before* the turn is sent, so it never enters the chat
transcript, provider context, or logs.  The non-secret nonce only correlates a
committed replay with its hidden turn; each pending replay remains one-shot and
bound to the session, source run, skill name, and replay mode even when turns
arrive out of order.
