"""Storage-free handoff for session prompt-cache keepalive candidates.

The engine captures only a provider-visible prefix that has already appeared
at the start of a successful real request.  The gateway may later replay that
prefix as an auxiliary provider call; the candidate itself never mutates
session history and contains no persistence behavior.
