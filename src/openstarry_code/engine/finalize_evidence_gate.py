"""Finalize-time red-evidence gate for coding-agent runs.

Challenges a finalization attempt that contradicts the run's own dynamic
evidence: the model is about to finish with a non-empty workspace diff while
(a) the latest execution-level command after its final source edit is red,
(b) a red command was later made green only by excluding/deselecting the
failing case, (c) most post-final-edit executions are red, (d) no
execution-level command ran after its final source edit, or (e) a
self-written reproduction/diagnostic script never passed (still red, or
deleted before a passing run was observed).

Strict mode (``OPENSTARRY_CODE_FINALIZE_EVIDENCE_STRICT``) adds one finalize-time
trigger on top of the same machinery: (f) ``zero_verification`` — no
execution-level command survived skip filtering at any point in the run, so
the change being shipped was never exercised at all. Red-first bookkeeping
(``red_first_satisfied`` / candidate counts, fed by the same deselection
profile machinery) is still tracked and reported for offline replay
diagnostics, but it does NOT gate: transcript replay over real runs showed
that "never observed failing then passing" is common on legitimately solved
runs (direct fix + existing suite green), so a trigger on it would challenge
correct finishes far too often.

Polarity contract: a failing self-written reproduction is BINDING evidence and
green results from unrelated suites do not override it; the challenge never
demands patch minimality, never devalues self-written repros, fires only at
finalize-time, and never blocks submission (bounded challenges, then the run
finishes normally).

The tracker is a pure, I/O-free state machine so the exact same semantics run
inside the live agent loop and in offline transcript replay
(``scripts/experiments/replay_finalize_gate.py``).
