"""Dependency-free heuristic router strategy for degraded installs.

When the bundled V4 Phase 3 ML runtime cannot load (missing ``recommended``
extra, missing native libraries, incomplete bundle assets), the router step
falls back to this strategy instead of pinning every turn to the default
tier. It classifies from cheap, deterministic surface features of the turn
that are already available at the step's classify seam — no ML runtime, no
network, and no dependencies beyond the standard library and in-tree pure
modules.

Feature bands (checked in order, first match wins):

``heavy`` → **c3 @ 0.60**
    Very long input (>= 12000 chars) or a multi-file shape (>= 3 fenced
    code blocks).

``code_or_material`` → **c2 @ 0.60**
    Any fenced code block, long input (>= 2500 chars), or non-image
    attachments on the turn (image attachments never reach this strategy —
    the step routes them to a vision tier before classification).

``short_plain`` → **c0 @ 0.55**
    Short plain text (<= 240 chars, no code fence).

``medium_plain`` → **c1 @ 0.55**
    Plain text up to 1200 chars.

``borderline_plain`` → **c1 @ 0.40**
    Plain text between 1200 and 2500 chars — long enough that c1 is a
    guess, not a call.

Confidence rationale
--------------------
The post-classifier confidence gate
(:func:`openstarry_code.engine.routing.policy.confidence_gate`) flattens any
tier other than the configured default whose confidence falls below the
threshold (default 0.5, discounted by 0.05 for tiers above the default).
The values above are chosen deliberately against those cutoffs:

* Confident bands sit at 0.55–0.60 — above both cutoffs — so the gate does
  not flatten every heuristic decision back to the default tier, which
  would recreate the silent ``v4_unavailable`` degradation this strategy
  replaces.
* They stay modest (< 0.7) so telemetry honestly reads them as low-signal
  guesses, and an operator who raises ``confidence_threshold`` above 0.6
  deliberately disables heuristic tiering in favor of their default tier.
* The ``borderline_plain`` band sits at 0.40 — below both cutoffs — so
  ambiguous mid-length plain text intentionally defers to the operator's
  configured ``default_tier``.

Decisions carry ``source="heuristic"`` and an ``extra`` payload mirroring
the V4 adapter shape (``route_class`` / ``thinking_mode`` /
``prompt_policy`` / ``model_version``) plus the observed feature values, so
history accumulation, the routing policy stages, and telemetry all flow
unchanged and remain distinguishable from real ML decisions.
