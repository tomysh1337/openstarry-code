"""Deterministic, on-device router calibration.

The bundled ML classifier is FROZEN. This module never retrains anything: it
aggregates local, prompt-free router decision records into a small, hard-clamped
adjustment to a single scalar — the confidence-gate ``confidence_threshold`` —
plus a per-tier confidence bias. The adjustment file lives in the runtime state
dir (``router_calibration.json``); the routing policy reads it as an argument
(never a file) and applies it as a bias in :func:`confidence_gate`.

Signals (all already recorded by ``router_decision_record`` / the V017
``router_decisions`` table, enum tokens + numbers only, no prompt text):

* ``confidence_gate`` applied  — the gate downgraded a proposed tier.
* ``complaint_upgrade`` applied — the user pushed back (routed too weak).
* ``source == "router_control_hold"`` — an operator pinned a tier.

Deliberately *out of scope* (kept conservative, per the overhaul's OQ#7):

* No "regeneration within N seconds" signal is derived — regeneration is NOT a
  calibration input this pass.
* No savings/cost figure is read or written — calibration adjusts the routing
  threshold/bias only, never the cost math (hard constraint C2).

Determinism: :func:`aggregate_calibration` is pure and takes an injected ``now``
(epoch ms) — no wall clock, no network, no I/O. Load/save tolerate a missing or
corrupt file by returning a neutral (zero-adjustment) state.

Hard clamps (non-negotiable, enforced at *read* time as well as write time):

* ``|per_class_bias[t]| <= 0.15``
* the adjusted ``confidence_threshold`` stays within ``[0.3, 0.7]``
