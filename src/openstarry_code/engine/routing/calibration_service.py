"""In-process 24h router calibration job.

A tiny background-loop service that periodically recomputes the on-device
calibration state from local decision records and writes
``router_calibration.json``. It shares the exact same pure aggregation
(:func:`openstarry_code.engine.routing.calibration.aggregate_calibration`) as the
``openstarry-code router calibrate`` CLI, so the CLI and the daily job never
diverge.

Opt-in: the gateway only constructs and starts this service when
``squilla_router.calibration_enabled`` is true (see ``gateway/boot.py``). With
the flag off — the default — no calibration job runs and the confidence gate is
byte-identical to today. The loop is fail-open: a tick failure is logged and the
next tick still runs.
