          Decision rules:
          - INAPPROPRIATE: project involves weapons, fire without
            supervision possibility, drugs, harmful chemistry,
            self-harm-adjacent themes, or other clearly unsafe topics
            for any minor.
          - SAFETY_REVIEW_REQUIRED: project involves heat (small stove,
            soldering iron), sharp blades (X-Acto knives), electronics
            with mains voltage, or moderately reactive chemistry. Adult
            must be present.
          - NEEDS_SHOPPING: project requires materials the household
            likely does not have (specific kit, model rocket motor,
            specialty paint).
          - NEEDS_ADULT_HELP: project is age-appropriate but a step
            requires hands the child does not yet have (cutting balsa
            wood for a 6-year-old, threading a needle for a 4-year-old).
          - STRAIGHTFORWARD: child can complete the bulk of the project
            with the declared PARENT_SUPERVISION level.

          {{ outputs.get('recall_past_projects', '') | truncate(1600) }}

          Source-constraint audit:
          - Treat the Project fact ledger as the source of truth. If an
            intermediate step conflicts with it, ignore the intermediate step.
          - Treat PROVIDED_MEMORY_CONTEXT in the fact ledger as user-relevant
            durable context. Preserve remembered age, child preferences, parent
            time limits, prior projects, and lessons learned unless the current
            request explicitly contradicts them.
          - If the fact ledger marks a detail UNKNOWN, leave it unknown or mark
            it as an assumption; do not fill it with common sense or current
            date/time.
          - Preserve every explicit user constraint before adding suggestions:
            age, deadline, location, available materials, budget,
            parent time, light/weather constraints, school deliverable, and
            requested output sections.
          - Do not replace user-provided materials with unrelated materials.
            Prefer the user's materials first, then list substitutes only as
            backups.
          - Do not invent calendar dates, school dates, temperature readings,
            weather forecasts, or live conditions. Use day numbers or say the
            exact date is unknown unless the user supplied one or live data was
            verified.
          - If the user gives only a relative deadline such as "two weeks
            later", do not convert it into a calendar date. Say "两周后 /
            relative deadline supplied; exact date not provided" and schedule
            by Day 1...Day 14.
          - Do not invent balcony direction, temperature ranges, sunshine
            hours, rain forecasts, school rules, allergies, or local weather.
            Keep weather/light claims to what the user supplied plus clearly
            labelled assumptions.
          - Do not prefill observation tables with fake measurements, fake
            dates, or predicted heights. For templates, leave measurement cells blank or as placeholders
            such as "__ cm" / "[记录]".
          - Do not suggest tasting or eating the experiment materials unless
            the user explicitly asks for an edible-food activity and safety has
            been reviewed. Observation projects should compare appearance,
            height, color, firmness by sight/touch if safe, and drawings.
          - Design a comparison experiment when it fits the project and stays
            within the user's materials, age, time budget, and safety limits.
            For observation projects, make the variable, control, and data table
            clear enough for a school presentation.
          - Prefer a clear comparison design for plant/observation projects:
            same seed, cup, water, and paper-towel conditions, with only one
            changed variable such as light exposure. If materials allow, use
            2-3 labelled groups; if not, make the single-group observation
            plan still presentation-ready.
          - "Printable" means a clean markdown table, worksheet block, or
            poster-board layout that the user can print from chat. Do not
            create or refer to PDFs, HTML files, downloads, attachments,
            local paths, generated artifacts, or workspace files unless the
            user explicitly asked for a file/PDF/export/download.
          - If the user asks for a beautiful or visually polished plan, make
            the inline markdown itself polished: a memorable title, a concise
            visual theme, color/palette suggestions, kid-facing labels,
            a drawing-heavy record sheet, and a parent-ready poster layout.
          - If the user asks to start with remembered constraints, include a
            section titled exactly "## Remembered constraints I used" near the
            top and list only facts found in PROVIDED_MEMORY_CONTEXT or the
            current request. Do not invent memory.

          Language and length:
          - Match the user's language. For Chinese requests, write Simplified
            Chinese throughout, including headings and child-facing text.
          - For Chinese requests, do not use English section headings such as
            "For You (the kid)" or "For the Grown-up".
          - Do not include vocabulary cards unless the user explicitly asked
            for vocab, word cards, bilingual support, 英语, 双语, or 单词.
          - For straightforward home/school projects, target 1800-3200 Chinese characters
            or an equivalent compact English length unless the user asks for a
            long worksheet.

          For Chinese safe projects, use this structure:

          # 🛠️ <Project Title>

          ## 先说假设
          State the age/deadline/material/weather assumptions and which facts
          are not live-verified.

          ## 项目设计
          Explain the child-friendly project question, final deliverable, and
          2-3 learning goals in plain language.

          ## 14 天计划
          Give an actionable schedule. Group days into phases when that is
          clearer than 14 long paragraphs, but preserve deadlines, daily
          observation habits, parent touchpoints, and what the child does.

          ## 材料和替代品
          Summarize the materials table and substitutions. Keep shopping and
          household alternatives practical.

          ## 安全和翻车点
          Include only the safety points that change behavior: stop-and-call
          conditions, allergy/toxin/sharp/hot/water/electricity risks where
          relevant, and 3 common failure modes with fixes.

          ## 数据记录和画图
          Include a simple observation template for date, height, leaf/color,
          water, light, and one child-friendly chart idea.

          ## 天气/光照调整
          Use live weather only if verified; otherwise state "live weather not
          verified / 实时天气未核验" and give safe indoor/low-light alternatives.

          ## 最后展示怎么讲
          Provide a 60-second child script and 3 likely teacher questions with
          simple answers.

          ## 家长每晚 20 分钟
          Summarize what the adult checks each night and which steps require
          hands-on help.

          ## 还缺哪些实时信息
          List only genuinely missing information that would improve the plan,
          without asking the user to confirm before using the current answer.

          For English safe projects, use equivalent English headings:
          remembered constraints used when requested, known facts and
          assumptions, project design, 14-day schedule,
          materials/substitutes, safety/failure modes, printable record
          sheet, poster-board layout, simple science explanation,
          Weather / light adjustment, adult 20-minute check, and missing live
          info. If the user asked for a visually polished plan, include a
          short "visual theme" subsection.

            redirect source is non-empty, return the unsafe redirect source as
            the final answer. Preserve its refusal and all safe alternative
            project ideas. Do not rebuild a normal project pack. End with
            PACK_DELIVERED: no_safety_redirect.
          - If the draft contains JSON keys such as "text", "artifacts",
            "artifact_ref", "download_url", "mime", "sha256", "session_id",
            "created_at", or "store", discard those metadata fields and write
            a normal markdown answer instead.
          - Remove leading process commentary such as "perfect match", "let me
            run it", "I will run", "workflow", "meta-skill", or any similar
            explanation of how the answer was produced. The first non-empty
            line must be the user-facing project title, unless the user
            explicitly requested a different first heading such as
            "Remembered constraints I used".
          - Preserve the user's language. If the request is English, write
            English-only prose and English headings. If the request is Chinese,
            write Simplified Chinese throughout.
          - Remove exact calendar dates, weekdays, months, or current-year references
            unless the user explicitly provided those exact dates. If the user
            gave only a relative deadline, use Day 1...Day 14 and say exact
            date not provided.
          - Remove invented balcony direction, temperature ranges, rain forecasts,
            sunshine hours, school rules, allergies, and local weather claims
            unless they appear in the fact ledger as verified or user-provided.
          - Remove fake sample measurements, fake dates, and predicted heights.
            Observation tables must leave measurement cells blank or as
            placeholders like "__ cm" / "[记录]".
          - Remove tasting/eating suggestions. For observation projects, compare
            height, color, firmness by safe touch if appropriate, drawings, and
            notes.
          - Keep every explicit user constraint from the fact ledger: child age,
            relative deadline, location, available materials, budget, parent
            time, light constraint, and requested sections.
          - Keep every clear durable-memory constraint from the fact ledger:
            remembered age, child preferences, writing tolerance, parent
            availability, prior projects, and lessons learned. Do not rewrite
            those fields as UNKNOWN when they appear in PROVIDED_MEMORY_CONTEXT.
          - If the request asks not to repeat previous projects, explicitly
            avoid or name the prior projects as non-options in one concise
            sentence.
          - If the user asks to use remembered facts, include a
            "## Remembered constraints I used" section with the remembered
            age, preferences, writing tolerance, parent time limit, prior
            projects, and lessons learned when those facts appear in
            PROVIDED_MEMORY_CONTEXT. Do not say no memory exists when
            PROVIDED_MEMORY_CONTEXT contains facts.
          - Prefer a clear comparison design when it fits: same seed, cup,
            water, and paper-towel conditions, with only light exposure changed.
          - Treat "printable record sheet" and "poster board layout" as inline
            deliverables unless the user explicitly asked for PDF/file/export.
            Include a clean markdown worksheet/table with blank boxes,
            checkboxes, or placeholders; do not claim that a PDF, HTML file,
            local file, download, or artifact was generated.
          - For visually polished project packs, make the markdown itself
            beautiful and school-ready: memorable title, visual theme or
            palette, kid-facing labels, drawing-heavy worksheet, and a poster
            layout the parent can recreate.
          - Keep the answer compact and immediately usable: target 2500-3600 Chinese characters
            for Chinese requests. Avoid long daily tables when grouped phases
            are clearer.

          Output structure for Chinese requests:
          # 🛠️ <title>
          ## 先说清楚哪些是已知、哪些未知
          ## 项目设计
          ## 14 天计划
          ## 材料和替代品
          ## 安全和翻车点
          ## 数据记录和画图

          ## 最后展示怎么讲
          ## 家长每晚 20 分钟
          ## 还缺哪些实时信息

          For English requests, use equivalent English headings only:
          # <Project title>
          ## Remembered constraints I used
          ## Known facts and assumptions
          ## Project design

# meta-kid-project-planner

Junior & guardian persona meta-skill. Turns a child's project idea —
"我要做火山", "I want to build a model rocket", "open a YouTube channel
about insects" — into a kid-friendly step plan PLUS a parent-friendly
oversight pack. The two audiences are concatenated in one markdown
deliverable with clear `## 👦 For You (the kid)` / `## 👨‍👩‍👧 For the
Grown-up` sections — a markdown-level workaround for the proposed
`audience:` primitive (portfolio design §4.2).

## Composition philosophy — multi-skill bundled orchestration

This meta-skill uses **only OpenSquilla-bundled atomic skills** plus
the five built-in step kinds — no external dependencies. The DAG calls
into **5 distinct bundled atomic skills**:

| Skill | Step(s) | Role in the DAG |
|---|---|---|
| `multi-search-engine` | `web_research` | Find existing how-to guides for the topic |
| `deep-research` | `deep_research` | Extra round for `SAFETY_REVIEW_REQUIRED` or `NEEDS_SHOPPING` feasibility |
| `memory` | `recall_past_projects`, `store_project` | Per-child memory: what they've already done; what they did this time. Avoids project repeats and builds a learning trajectory. |
| `weather` | `weather_check` | When the topic is outdoor / garden / park, pull a 7-day forecast so `outline_steps` can recommend the best day |
| `pptx` | `kid_deck` | When `PARENT_SUPERVISION: HANDS_ON`, produce a printable slide deck for the kid (visual step-by-step + safety callouts) |

Step kinds used: `llm_chat`, `llm_classify`, `user_input`, `skill_exec`,
`agent`.

Vocab card generation is a plain `llm_chat` step (`vocab_cards`)
grounded in `outputs.outline_steps + outputs.material_list` — the LLM
produces 6 age-appropriate cards directly. No external flashcard
skill is required.

Bilingual rendering for `LANGUAGE: mixed` is also prompt-side in the
relevant steps — no separate translation skill required.

## Safety design

Three layers of guardrail:

1. `preferences` step rejects clearly inappropriate topics by setting
   `PROJECT_SAFE: no` in its contract. This is prompt-side; cannot be
   bypassed by clever phrasing because the model's response is
   constrained to the return format.
2. `feasibility` classifier produces `INAPPROPRIATE` for any topic
   that involves weapons, dangerous chemistry, fire-without-adult,
   self-harm-adjacent themes. `INAPPROPRIATE` short-circuits the
   project pack and routes to `redirect_unsafe`.
3. `redirect_unsafe` produces a gentle, non-shaming redirect with 3
   alternative project ideas that scratch the same itch safely.

The skill never silently degrades safety — if the topic is unsafe, the
deliverable IS the redirect, with `PACK_DELIVERED: no_safety_redirect`.

## Honest limitations (first-wave)

- **`audience:` is markdown sections, not real two-principal output.**
  When the proposed primitive ships, the kid section can go to a
  child-facing surface while the parent section goes to the guardian's
  channel, separately.
- **No persistence of past projects.** Each invocation is independent
  — without `state:`, the skill cannot remember which projects the
  child has already done.
- **Vocab cards do not feed an FSRS deck.** The `vocab_cards` step
  emits a one-shot card list; integrating with a spaced-repetition
  state machine is reserved for a future `meta-spaced-rep-coach`.
- **Topic safety relies on prompt-side guardrails.** A future
  dedicated safety-policy step kind would be more robust than
  prompt-side judgment under adversarial inputs.
