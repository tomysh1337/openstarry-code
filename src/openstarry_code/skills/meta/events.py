"""Internal event types used between the meta-orchestrator scheduler and its
step executors.

:class:`_StepDone` terminates a step's streaming sub-iterator and carries
the step's final string output back through the same channel as
forwarded ``AgentEvent``\\s, so executors do not need a side-channel
(mutable holder / instance variable) to return text. The scheduler
strips ``_StepDone`` before forwarding the outer stream to callers;
consumers never see it.

:func:`yield_skill_view_preface` is the pre-step ``skill_view`` tool
invocation emitted before ``skill_exec`` / ``agent`` steps so the UI
can show the loaded skill body inline as a tool-call card. Lives here
(not in ``executors/``) because it's a UI affordance, not a step body.
