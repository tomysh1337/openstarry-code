"""Fail-closed replay policy for non-idempotent paid meta steps.

Paid generation entrypoints communicate only one positive fact to the parent:
the process failed before any provider submission was possible.  Every other
failure of a step declared as ``external_paid_submit`` is treated as possibly
accepted/billed.  The durable marker is intentionally stored with the step
error so reconnect recovery and a later gateway process enforce the same
decision as the live scheduler.
