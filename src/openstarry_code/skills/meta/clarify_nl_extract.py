"""Opt-in LLM extractor for user_input replies (design §5.5).

Activated only when the SKILL.md author sets ``nl_extract: true`` on a
user_input step. A single LLM call asks the model to produce a JSON object
whose keys are a subset of the active field names; the returned values are
then validated against the same ``ClarifyField`` rules used by the
deterministic parser.

Design constraints:
* Single call per reply (no tool loop, no follow-up turn).
* JSON-only output, keys white-listed against ``active_fields``.
* Validators reapplied so prompt injection in user replies cannot
  bypass type/range/choice checks.
* ``<user_reply>`` tags scope what the model treats as user input.

The extractor is invoked from ``meta_resolution`` only when:
  schema.nl_extract is True
  AND an llm_chat callable is wired

Otherwise this module is dormant.
