          listed below. Filter for paths ending in `.py` only.

          Staged files:

          If the staged list is NO_STAGED_FILES or contains no .py files, treat

          live under `src/openstarry_code/` (skip files outside that tree because
          the project's mypy config only covers the package).

          Staged files:

          If no `src/openstarry_code/**` files are staged, treat as PASS.

          Reply with EXACTLY one line, no preamble:

          Identify pytest files affected by these staged files (any
          `tests/test_*.py` that imports or references a same-named module).
          Run `uv run pytest -q -x --tb=short` on the affected subset; if you
          cannot localise, run the default-path suite with the same flags.

            - mypy:   {{ outputs.run_mypy }}
            - pytest: {{ outputs.run_pytest }}

          Apply the rule STRICTLY (do NOT soften):
            * If ANY of the three starts with "FAIL" → final verdict is BLOCK.
              The BLOCK summary concatenates each failing gate's verbatim text.
            * If ALL three start with "PASS" → final verdict is APPROVE.

          Reply with EXACTLY this structure on the first line, then optionally
          additional lines:

# Pre-Commit Quality Gate (Meta-Skill)

A **combinator-style** meta-skill that runs three independent quality
gates in parallel over the currently-staged diff, then arbitrates a
single ship-readiness verdict.

## Trigger surface

Fire by saying `pre-commit quality gate` or one of the localized triggers
listed in the frontmatter. The skill is also designed to be invoked from a git
pre-commit hook via the soft path (`meta_invoke`), but hook installation is a
separate manual step.

## Fallback

If the orchestrator fails (sub-Agent error, timeout, etc.), the
caller should manually run, in order: `uv run ruff check src tests`,
`uv run mypy src/openstarry_code --show-error-codes`, then
`uv run pytest -q`. The same three commands are the CI quality gate
in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
