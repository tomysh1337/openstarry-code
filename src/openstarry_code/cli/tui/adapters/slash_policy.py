"""Registry-backed slash-command scheduling for the concurrent TUI runtime.

Command meaning belongs to :mod:`openstarry_code.engine.commands`.  This adapter
projects the canonical busy/presentation metadata into the small set of input
kinds understood by the TUI loop:

* turn presentations keep the ordinary prompt/steer/queue contract;
* immediate and next-turn control commands dispatch out of band;
* query/navigation commands dispatch through the command plane without a
  prompt echo;
* require-idle commands are explicitly rejected by the runtime while busy;
* abort-and-run and drain-and-exit retain their existing lifecycle semantics.

Unknown slash input is also command-plane input.  Dispatching it immediately
lets the canonical handler report ``Unknown command`` without first rendering
or queueing it as a user message.
