The themes themselves live in the JS host (``package/src/theme.mjs``). This module
only mirrors the theme NAMES so the CLI can list/validate them and drive live
switching by sending a ``theme.set`` IPC message through the OpenTUI output handle.
The name list is kept in sync with ``theme.mjs`` by a conformance test.
