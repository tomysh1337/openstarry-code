"""Filesystem cleanup for session-owned material on session delete.

``SQLiteSessionStorage.delete_session`` removes DB rows only. The two on-disk
session-material stores must be removed too, or they accumulate forever (session
delete leaves them behind and the global transcript disk budget eventually
hard-fails every new staged attachment):

1. the canonical transcript-material store ``<media_root>/transcripts/<sid>/``;
2. the tool-visible workspace materialization
   ``<workspace>/.openstarry-code/attachments/<segment>/``.

The cleanup is a process-global hook (matching the ``set_upload_store`` pattern)
so every ``delete_session`` caller — the ``sessions.delete`` RPC, the cron
reaper, and ``prune_stale_sessions`` — triggers it through the single DB choke
point without threading config through the low-level storage class.

This module intentionally holds only the hook registry and a generic, guarded
directory remover — no config/workspace resolution — so the low-level
``session`` package does not depend on higher layers (``agents``, gateway). The
concrete cleanup that resolves the media root + agent workspace is built at boot
(see ``gateway.boot.build_session_material_cleanup``) and registered here.
