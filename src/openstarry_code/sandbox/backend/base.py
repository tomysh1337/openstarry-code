"""Backend abstract interface.

A backend is stateless: each :meth:`Backend.run` call materialises its own
sandbox (per-command ephemeral lifecycle) and releases it at completion or
cancellation. Backends must surface setup failures by raising
:class:`~openstarry_code.sandbox.types.SandboxBackendError`; they must never fall
back to unsandboxed host execution on failure.

``probe`` / ``available`` is separated from ``run`` so callers can pre-flight
backend readiness (e.g. during gateway boot) without spawning a process.
