// presentational: section ids, routes, panels, readiness, and save behaviour are
// unchanged — the rail is only reordered and captioned. Order matters because the
// rail (and the dirty-bar summary) reads top-to-bottom; it now mirrors the setup
// dependency order (Model Service → Model Routing → Capabilities) so the coupled
// panels sit adjacent instead of being split by Behavior/Privacy.
