# Third Party Notices

This file records third-party attribution for assets bundled with OpenSquilla.
It covers:

- The bundled skill descriptors under `src/openstarry_code/skills/bundled/`, which
  include OpenClaw-derived MIT descriptors and OpenSquilla-original descriptors.
- The bundled pptx skill references the python-pptx and PptxGenJS libraries;
  OpenSquilla does not vendor those libraries, but the skill instructs the
  agent runtime to invoke them and is documented here for transparency.
- The local SquillaRouter V4 Phase 3 model bundle under
  `src/openstarry_code/squilla_router/models/v4.2_phase3_inference/`.
- Web UI runtime dependencies, bundled fonts, and generated Control UI assets.
- The Web UI "Arctic" theme color palette, adapted from the Nord palette under
  the MIT license; see the dedicated section below.
- The built-in tokenjuice tool-result projection backend and bundled
  reduction rules under `src/openstarry_code/plugins/tokenjuice/`.
- Optional managed toolchains downloaded after explicit user confirmation;
  these binaries are not embedded in the OpenSquilla wheel or source tree.
- The cron prompt-injection scanner was reviewed against Hermes Agent
  reference material; the MIT notice is reproduced below for conservative
  attribution.

## Web UI dependencies and bundled fonts

OpenSquilla builds the Vue Control UI from npm dependencies and locally bundled
fonts. Release artifacts contain the generated browser assets under
`src/openstarry_code/gateway/static/dist/`; the dependency sources and exact
resolved versions are recorded by `openstarry-code-webui/package.json` and
`openstarry-code-webui/package-lock.json`.

The Web UI lockfile is the version authority for these dependencies. The build
pipeline regenerates the browser bundle from that lockfile; no separate
hand-maintained copies of these libraries are shipped by the gateway.

The MIT license text is reproduced in this file for MIT-licensed bundled
components. The Apache License 2.0 text is reproduced in the repository
`LICENSE` file. The SIL Open Font License 1.1 text for the bundled fonts is
reproduced below.

```
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified
Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright
Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain
under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font
Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

## Arctic theme color palette (Nord)

- Component: Web UI "Arctic" value theme color palette in
  `openstarry-code-webui/src/themes/arctic/tokens.css` (and its generated Web UI CSS
  assets).
- Upstream project: https://www.nordtheme.com
- License: MIT
- Copyright notice: Copyright (c) Sven Greb and the Nord contributors

The "Arctic" theme's color values are adapted from the Nord palette. OpenSquilla
is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by the Nord project; the
palette is reused under the MIT license solely for its color values, with a
matching attribution header reproduced at the top of the theme's `tokens.css`.
Some values are lightened from the upstream palette so the theme passes
OpenSquilla's WCAG contrast guards. The MIT license text is reproduced below.

## Optional managed toolchains downloaded at runtime

OpenSquilla does not embed the following toolchains in its source distribution
or wheel. The Web setup flow presents their source, version, license, and known
download size, asks for explicit consent, and then stores verified artifacts in
the user's OpenSquilla state directory. Each downloaded component remains under
its upstream terms.

| Runtime component | Catalog source | Catalog license / provenance note |
|---|---|---|
| TinyTeX 2026.05 / TeX Live packages | https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex-releases | TinyTeX release repository: GPL-2.0. The self-contained verified archive is not updated from the floating TeX Live network. Its included packages remain governed by their own TeX Live catalog metadata, and upstream license files remain in the downloaded tree. |
| FFmpeg / FFprobe macOS 8.1.2 ZIPs | https://ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de/ | GPL-3.0-or-later builds selected separately for Apple Silicon and Intel, with the build source pinned to commit [`bb1d6db29cee948f9685bcd69e6caf17d960662b`](https://git.martin-riedl.de/ffmpeg/build-script/commit/bb1d6db29cee948f9685bcd69e6caf17d960662b). Each original ZIP is verified by fixed byte size and SHA-256 before extraction. Because the embedded binary signatures are invalid, OpenSquilla then removes them, applies a local ad-hoc signature, and requires strict `codesign` verification before activation. This local signature is not a Developer ID signature or Apple notarization. The matching pinned GPL license assets are installed beside the binaries. These builds require macOS 12 or later. |
| FFmpeg Linux static GPL builds | https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds | GPL-3.0-or-later catalog build. |
| FFmpeg Windows essentials build | https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg | GPL build; upstream license files remain in the downloaded archive. |
| Noto Sans CJK 2.004 regular font | https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk/tree/Sans2.004 | SIL Open Font License 1.1. The pinned license file is downloaded and checksum-verified beside the font; the OFL text is also reproduced earlier in this notice. |

The built-in catalog records fixed URLs, byte sizes, and SHA-256 values for
every executable archive, license file, and font download. OpenSquilla neither
republishes these toolchains as part of its releases nor claims ownership of
them.

## npm and Python dependency packaging strategy

OpenSquilla uses npm lockfiles for the Web UI and Electron shell and `uv.lock`
for Python release environments. Lockfiles pin dependency resolution for
reproducible builds, but lockfiles are not a replacement for third-party license
notices when source, minified JavaScript, fonts, model files, or adapted code
are copied into OpenSquilla release artifacts.

Build-time npm dependencies are installed from the package registry during CI.
The Electron and gateway release artifacts distribute the compiled Control UI,
selected static assets, updater metadata, and packaged runtime outputs rather
than the full npm source tree. Any static npm-derived file copied into
`src/openstarry_code/gateway/static/` must be listed in this notices file or in a
component-local notice file.

Python dependencies are resolved from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` during
wheel, portable, and packaged-gateway builds. Python packages remain governed by
their upstream package metadata and licenses. If OpenSquilla vendors or adapts
Python package code, model files, rule files, binary assets, or generated
runtime artifacts into the repository, the component must be recorded here or
in a package-local provenance file.

## OpenClaw-derived bundled skill descriptors

- Component: SKILL.md frontmatter and instruction text for these bundled skills:
  - `sub-agent`
- `cron`
  - `github`
  - `nano-pdf`
  - `skill-creator`
  - `summarize`
  - `tmux`
  - `weather`
- Upstream project: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
- License: MIT
- Copyright notice: Copyright (c) 2025 Peter Steinberger

Note: `sub-agent` was renamed from `coding-agent` on 2026-05-23; the
descriptor retains the same OpenClaw upstream lineage and MIT attribution.

The descriptor text instructs the agent runtime how to use built-in skill
surfaces and external tools; OpenSquilla does not redistribute third-party CLIs
through these descriptors. Per the MIT license, the upstream copyright and
permission notice are reproduced below in their entirety and apply to the
OpenClaw-derived bundled descriptor files.

## Router Artifact Safety Note

The SquillaRouter bundle contains `.pkl` and `.joblib` artifacts used by the
current V4 Phase 3 runtime. Treat these artifacts as executable-code-equivalent
inputs: load only assets shipped with a trusted OpenSquilla release or assets
whose checksums match `artifact_manifest.json`.
